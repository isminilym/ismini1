-Narcissism: According to DSM-5 narcissistic personality disorder(NPD) is defined as comprising a pervasive pattern of grandiosity (in fantasy or behavior), a constant need for admiration, and a lack of empathy, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts

-Posting selfies behavior: Selfie taking recently become a social phenomenon and international trend. Selfie is a photograph that one has taken of oneself, generally clicked with a Smartphone or a web camera and shared through social media.



Methods
========================================================
Hypotheses
Is there any interaction between posting selfies behavior and narcissism? 

Our Data retrieved from Google Trends based on Google Search. Specifically, we analyze how the number of Google searches for term narcissism relates to the number of Google searches for term selfies between September 2013 and June 2016 in Sweden. This time period is related to the fact that we wanted to look up search data in a period when instagram launched.



Planed analyses
========================================================
We use Pearsons correlation coefficient to analyze the influence of instagram appearance on the correlation between narcissism and posting selfies behavior. The Pearson Correlation shows the linear relationship between two sets of data and how well they are related. The results will be between -1 and 1. The closer the value of r gets to zero, the greater the variation the data points are around the line of best fit. Because all data from Google Trends is quantitative, we express the statistical relationship with a correlation coefficient. 

We also used p-value to evaluate the data, which tells us the significance of the Pearson correlation coefficient, given the correlation value r and the sample size. The p-value is a range from 0 to 1 with a p-value of less than .05 we consider statistically significant.
